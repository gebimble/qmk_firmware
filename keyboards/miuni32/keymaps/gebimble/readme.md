# gebimble keymap for miuni32

Nothing *super* fancy, but here are the major changes that have been
implemented through this keymap:

- Workman key layout added
- space and right shift as a hold/toggle on the former ; key (row 2, column 12)
- ctrl and alt mapped as hold/toggle keys on f & j, and d & k respectively
- layer toggle 1 moved to row 2, column 13
- layer toggle 2 moved to row 2, column 1
- layer toggle 3 moved to row 3, column 13
- home, page down, page up, end, left, down, up, right moved to layer 3, row 2, columns 2--9 inclusive
- non-row 1 non-base layer keys moved to layer 1/2 positions on the side of the board opposite to the layer toggle key
- symbols almost entirely changed to UK variants
