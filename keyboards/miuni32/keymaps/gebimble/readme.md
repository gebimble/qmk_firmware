# gebimble layout

Nothing *super* fancy with regards the default layout, but I have implemented some personal usability tweaks that other users may find helpful.

Here are the major changes/features:

- Workman layout added
- space and right shift as a hold/toggle on the former enter key (row 2, column 12)
- ctrl and alt mapped as hold/toggle keys on f & j, and d & k respectively
- layer toggle 1 moved to row 3, column 6 (for use with right thumb)
- layer toggle 2 moved to row 3, column 5 (for use with left thumb)
- layer toggle 3 moved to row 3, column 13
- home, page down, page up, end, left, down, up, right moved to layer 3, row 2, columns 2--9 inclusive
- non-row 1 non-base layer keys moved to numbers/symbols layer positions on the side of the board opposite to the layer toggle key
- symbols almost entirely changed to UK variants
